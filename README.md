# FPTools

![](icon.png)

 A set Mathematica tools I frequently use for debugging, introspection &c.

For the time being, a small amount of documentation can be had by looking in the Mathematica Help Browser under "Add-ons and Packages".

Also, the Wiki for this project might have some of the automatically generated stuff as per [Arnoud Buzing's](https://github.com/arnoudbuzing) `prototypes` package [https://github.com/arnoudbuzing/prototypes](https://github.com/arnoudbuzing/prototypes). `prototypes` is a nice addition to these tools. It is required to **build** these tools but not to install or use the Paclet.
