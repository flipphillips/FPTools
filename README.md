# FPTools

v 1.0.8

A set Mathematica tools I frequently use for debugging, introspection &c.
**Note that there is a bunch of seemingly unrelated stuff in recent versions. This is because I am using this to easily distribute some tools for my classes this semester. At some point I'll refactor all this out, but for now it remains!**

For the time being, a small amount of documentation can be had by looking in the Mathematica Help Browser under "Add-ons and Packages".

Requires [Arnoud Buzing's](https://github.com/arnoudbuzing) `prototypes` package [https://github.com/arnoudbuzing/prototypes](https://github.com/arnoudbuzing/prototypes). `prototypes` is a nice addition to these tools. It is required to **build** and use these tools.
